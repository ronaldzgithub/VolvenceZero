"""Convenience facade for building a Lifeform from a CharacterSoulProfile.

Mirrors :func:`lifeform_domain_emogpt.build_companion_lifeform` but for
the reviewed-character vertical: takes a profile, compiles it through
the three pure builders, and returns a :class:`lifeform_core.Lifeform`
with the package + vitals applied.

Why a facade exists:

A consumer that just wants to spin up a "Zhang Wuji as a lifeform"
should not have to know which builder produces which artifact, or
how :class:`LifeformConfig` is composed. The facade encodes the
canonical wiring — domain experience package + vitals bootstrap +
optional ingestion envelope — once, in one place.

Why the ingestion envelope is RETURNED rather than auto-drained:

Ingestion through the canonical path
(``LifeformSession.run_turn(..., trigger_kind=INGESTION)``) is
intrinsically a per-session operation. The facade builds a
:class:`Lifeform`, which is a per-process factory; it has no session
to drain into yet. So we return ``(Lifeform, IngestionEnvelope |
None)`` and let the caller decide when to drain — typically right
after ``create_session`` and before the first user turn.

    Steps:

    1. Compile profile into a :class:`DomainExperiencePackage` and
       attach it via ``LifeformConfig.with_domain_experience``.
    2. If ``use_vitals_bootstrap`` is true (default), compile the
       drive priors into a :class:`VitalsBootstrap` and attach via
       ``LifeformConfig.with_vitals``.
    3. Construct the :class:`Lifeform`. If ``memory_store`` is
       provided it is forwarded so multiple sessions / multiple
       lifeforms can share the same long-term memory (the canonical
       Tier 3 evidence pattern).
    4. If ``novel_excerpt`` is provided, build an
       :class:`IngestionEnvelope` (source_kind=BOOK) keyed to this
       profile and return it on the bundle for the caller to drain.

    Args:
        profile: Reviewed character profile.
        config: Optional :class:`LifeformConfig` override. Defaults
            to a fresh ``LifeformConfig()`` with rare-heavy disabled.
        novel_excerpt: Optional plain-text excerpt to wrap as an
            ingestion envelope. ``None`` means no envelope is built;
            the bundle's ``ingestion_envelope`` is then ``None``.
        novel_uploader: Operator id for envelope provenance.
        novel_max_chunk_chars: Chunk size for the ingestion envelope
            (default 1024; smaller than ``lifeform_ingestion``'s
            default 2048 so a moderate excerpt produces enough chunks
            to exercise the multi-chunk path).
        novel_compliance_profile: Vitals override semantics for
            ingestion (default ``FORCED`` — operator-supplied content
            does not generate vitals resistance).
        use_vitals_bootstrap: When true, attach the character's
            vitals bootstrap. Set false for ablation runs.
        memory_store: Optional shared :class:`MemoryStore` for
            cross-session continuity. When ``None``, the lifeform's
            sessions get fresh per-session stores (default behaviour).

    Returns:
        A :class:`CharacterLifeformBundle` carrying the constructed
        lifeform, the profile (for traceability), and an optional
        ingestion envelope.
